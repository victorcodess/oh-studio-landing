# OH.STUDIO Landing â€” Replica

In this project, I recreated the landing page of [Oli Harris](https://twitter.com/olvhrs)'s portfolio website. This was a challenge from [Frontend Practice.](https://oh-studio-landing.vercel.app/)  The project involves building a responsive website for a design agency called OH Studio. The website should have a clean and modern design, with a homepage showcasing the agency's work, services, and contact.


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion.

**Hosting:** Vercel.

## Learnings

In this project I learnt a couple of new things, especially CSS and JavaScript animations. The toughest part was recreating the hover animations on the project cards and also animating the SVG stroke-width and translate properties. I also used react-intersection-observer to animate the text fading in on both page load and while scrolling. I used CSS backdrop filters to create the blurred glass effect on the fixed navigation menu.
